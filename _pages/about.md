I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University, working with Professors H. Vincent Poor and Mung Chiang on various topics spanning distributed machine learning algorithms and signal processing. Before Princeton, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science advised by Professor Thang N. Dinh from Virginia Commonwealth University in 2018 and then spent a year as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University working with Professor Leman Akoglu on graph mining and anomaly detection with applications in finance.

Research Interests:
- Decentralized Optimization
- Machine Learning
- Digital Signal Processing
- Large-scale Graph Mining
- Social Network Analysis
- Combinatorial Optimizations
- Approximation Algorithms
